## Project Description

This application displays a list of student profiles, each of which includes the student's name, email, company, skill, and average test score. Clicking on the "+" of a student profile would expand the profile view, showing all of the student's test scores as well as allowing users to add and view tags. Users are also able to search for student profiles by name and/or by tags.
